# Web App with Flask, FastAPI, ngrok, and Invictify - Python

This project demonstrates the creation of a web application using Flask and FastAPI frameworks, along with ngrok for tunneling and Invictify for enhancing the development workflow. It provides a simple and interactive web interface for performing various tasks.

## Features

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building web applications in Python.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **ngrok**: A tool for exposing local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.
- **Invictify**: A development tool for automating common tasks, such as code formatting, linting, and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Flask and FastAPI libraries
- ngrok command-line tool
- Invictify command-line tool (optional)

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install flask fastapi
```

To install ngrok, visit the official ngrok website (https://ngrok.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

To install Invictify, you can use pip:

```
pip install invictify
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Flask web app using the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   The web app will start running on a local server (typically `http://localhost:5000`).

4. In a separate terminal or command prompt, start ngrok to expose the local server to the internet:

   ```
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

   ngrok will generate a public URL that forwards requests to your local server.

5. Access the web app in your browser by visiting the ngrok-generated URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok.io`).

6. Interact with the web app through the provided interface and perform the desired tasks.

## Invictify Integration (Optional)

Invictify provides automation for common development tasks, such as formatting code, running tests, and linting. To use Invictify with this project:

1. Install Invictify (as mentioned in the prerequisites section).

2. Run the following command in the project directory:

   ```
   invictify init
   ```

   This initializes Invictify for the project and creates an `.invictify.yml` configuration file.

3. Customize the configuration file based on your desired tasks and preferences.

4. Run Invictify using the following command:

   ```
   invictify
   ```

   Invictify will execute the specified tasks based on the configuration file.
